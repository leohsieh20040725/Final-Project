<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About the Project

This project is part of the GEOL0069 AI4EO course at University College London. The goal is to detect flood-affected areas using Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery by applying a widely used remote sensing index (NDWI) and a supervised machine learning algorithm (Random Forest). The project outputs include a binary classification map (flooded / non-flooded) and an analysis of computational/environmental impact.

## Background

Floods are one of the most destructive natural disasters globally, affecting millions of people every year. Early and accurate detection of flood extent using satellite imagery is a vital tool for disaster response, infrastructure planning, and humanitarian relief.

Compared to manual surveying, remote sensing allows for rapid, scalable, and low-cost flood detection. By combining multispectral satellite data with machine learning, this project demonstrates how flooded areas can be automatically identified with minimal manual input.

## The SENTINEL-2 Satellite

SENTINEL-2 is a European Earth observation mission with two satellites (S2A & S2B), designed to provide high-resolution optical imagery for land monitoring. Each carries the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI), capturing 13 spectral bands:

- 4 bands at 10m (visible and NIR)
- 6 bands at 20m (including SWIR)
- 3 bands at 60m (atmospheric correction)

These bands make Sentinel-2 suitable for applications such as vegetation monitoring, water detection, and land use classification.

## Remote Sensing Method â€“ NDWI

To extract water bodies, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is used:


- Green = Band 3 (560 nm)
- NIR = Band 8 (842 nm)

NDWI emphasizes water features while suppressing soil and vegetation. Pixels with higher NDWI values typically represent water surfaces, especially useful for flood detection after major rainfall events.

---

## Machine Learning Method â€“ Random Forest

To automate classification, we use a **Random Forest** classifier. It is chosen for its:
- Simplicity
- Fast training
- High accuracy on small datasets

### Workflow:
1. Calculate NDWI from Sentinel-2 imagery
2. Create labeled training samples (flooded/non-flooded)
3. Train Random Forest on NDWI data
4. Apply model to full scene
5. Generate binary flood classification map

# Getting Started

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `rasterio`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`
- Jupyter or Google Colab

### Instructions:
1. Clone this repo and open the `flood_classification.ipynb` notebook
2. Modify file paths if needed
3. Run all cells in order
4. Visual outputs will include NDWI images and classification maps

## Datasets Used

Sentinel-2 L2A imagery was used (surface reflectance). Pre- and post-flood scenes were selected from a recent flood-prone region (e.g. Italy, Bangladesh, UK).

Images were downloaded from the [Copernicus Dataspace Browser](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/).

# Environmental Cost

The model was trained on a CPU with no GPU acceleration.

| Component        | Details                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Model            | Random Forest (100 trees)        |
| Training time    | ~15 seconds                      |
| Platform         | Local CPU (Intel i5)             |
| COâ‚‚ estimate     | ~0.005 kg                        |

Tools like [CodeCarbon](https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/) can be used for more detailed reporting.
